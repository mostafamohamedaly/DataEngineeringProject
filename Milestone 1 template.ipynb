    "- Observe missing data and comment on why you believe it is missing(MCAR,MAR or MNAR) \n",
    "- Observe duplicate data\n",
    "- Observe outliers\n",
    "- After observing outliers,missing data and duplicates, handle any unclean data.\n",
    "- With every change you are making to the data you need to comment on why you used this technique and how has it affected the data(by both showing the change in the data i.e change in number of rows/columns,change in distrubution, etc and commenting on it).\n",
    "- Data transformation and feature engineering\n",
    "- Add a new column named 'Week number' and discretisize the data into weeks according to the dates.Tip: Change the datatype of the date feature to datetime type instead of object.\n",
    "- Encode any categorical feature(s) and comment on why you used this technique and how the data has changed.\n",
    "- Identify feature(s) which need normalisation and show your reasoning.Then choose a technique to normalise the feature(s) and comment on why you chose this technique.\n",
    "- Add atleast two more columns which adds more info to the dataset by evaluating specific feature(s). I.E( Column indicating whether the accident was on a weekend or not). \n",
    "- For any imputation with arbitrary values or encoding done, you have to store what the value imputed or encoded represents in a new csv file. I.e if you impute a missing value with -1 or 100 you must have a csv file illustrating what -1 and 100 means. Or for instance, if you encode cities with 1,2,3,4,etc what each number represents must be shown in the new csv file.\n",
    "- Load the new dataset into a csv file.\n",
    "- **Extremely Important note** - Your code should be as generic as possible and not hard-coded and be able to work with various datasets. Any hard-coded solutions will be severely penalised.\n",
    "- Bonus: Load the dataset as a parquet file instead of a csv file(Parquet file is a compressed file format)."

Philosophy involves a methodical assessment of any and all aspects of human existence and experience. The realms of philosophy and religion have sometimes intersected in conducting such inquiries as these. As with philosophy, the study of religion underscores how humankind has long speculated about its origins.
